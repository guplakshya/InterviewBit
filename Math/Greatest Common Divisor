############ Greatest Common Divisor ##############

/*

Given 2 non negative integers m and n, find gcd(m, n)

GCD of 2 integers m and n is defined as the greatest integer g such that g is a divisor of both m and n.
Both m and n fit in a 32 bit signed integer.

*/

Java Solution:

public int gcd(int A, int B) {
        if(A==0)
            return B;
        if(B==0)
            return A;
        if(A>B)
            return gcd(A-B,B);
        return gcd(A,B-A);
    }
